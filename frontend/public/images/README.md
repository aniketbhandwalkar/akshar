## child.png
Please add a background image named `child.png` to this directory. This image will be used as the background for the reading test page.

Recommended specifications:
- Format: PNG or JPG
- Size: 1920x1080 or similar high resolution
- Content: Child-friendly background image (e.g., books, learning environment, etc.)
- Ensure the image is not too busy or distracting as text will be overlaid on it

If no image is provided, the reading test will still function but without the background image.
