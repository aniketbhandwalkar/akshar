## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React 18 with TypeScript
- React Router for navigation
- Styled Components for UI
- Axios for API calls
- WebGazer.js for eye tracking

### Backend
- Node.js with Express.js
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- JWT authentication
- Google Gemini AI for reading passages
- PDFKit for report generation
- Security middleware (helmet, CORS, rate limiting)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB Atlas account (or local MongoDB)
- Google Gemini API key

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables in `.env`:
   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://scraperpilot3_db_user:akshar1409@cluster0.08kfcql.mongodb.net/akshar_dyslexia_db?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here_generate_a_random_string
   PORT=5000
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables in `.env`:
   ```env
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
   ```

4. Add a background image for the reading test:
   - Place a child-friendly background image named `child.png` in `public/images/`
   - Recommended size: 1920x1080 or similar high resolution

5. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Development Notes

- Frontend runs on port 3000
- Backend runs on port 5000
- MongoDB connection string is pre-configured
- WebGazer.js loads from CDN during reading tests
- PDF generation happens server-side

## Production Deployment

1. Set NODE_ENV=production in backend .env
2. Build frontend: `npm run build`
3. Serve frontend build files
4. Update CORS origins for production domains
5. Use production MongoDB cluster
